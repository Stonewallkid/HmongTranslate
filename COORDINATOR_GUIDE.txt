5. Include timestamps for long recordings

TRACKING TRANSCRIPTIONS
-----------------------
Create a spreadsheet with columns:
- Recording ID
- Speaker ID (original speaker)
- Transcriber ID
- Transcription status (not started / in progress / complete)
- Verification status (not started / in progress / verified)
- Translation status (not started / in progress / complete)
