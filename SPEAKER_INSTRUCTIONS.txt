               HMONG TRANSLATION PROJECT - SPEAKER INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Thank you for volunteering to help build Hmong translation technology!
These instructions will help you record high-quality audio at home.


BEFORE YOU START
================================================================================

1. EQUIPMENT NEEDED
   - Computer with a microphone (built-in or external)
   - Chrome, Firefox, or Safari web browser
   - Quiet room

2. FIND A QUIET SPACE
   - Turn off TV, radio, fans, air conditioning if possible
   - Close windows to reduce outside noise
   - Choose a room with carpet/curtains (less echo)
   - Let family members know you'll be recording

3. TEST YOUR MICROPHONE
   - Make sure your browser can access your microphone
   - When you first click "Start" recording, your browser will ask permission
   - Click "Allow" to grant microphone access


RECORDING TIPS
================================================================================

1. SPEAK CLEARLY
   - Use your normal speaking voice
   - Don't speak too fast or too slow
   - Pronounce words clearly but naturally

2. CONSISTENT DISTANCE
   - Keep the same distance from the microphone throughout
   - About 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) is ideal
   - Don't move around while recording

3. WAIT BEFORE SPEAKING
   - After clicking "Start", wait 1 second before speaking
   - After finishing, wait 1 second before clicking "Stop"
   - This gives clean audio without cut-off words

4. IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE
   - Click "Re-record" to try again
   - It's okay to pause and restart
   - Quality is more important than speed

5. TAKE BREAKS
   - Recording for 1-1.5 hours at a time is enough
   - Rest your voice between sessions
   - Stay hydrated!
